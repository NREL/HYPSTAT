#Scenario design:
nodes: ['B','A','C','D','E','F'] #nodes to consider
#gen_techs: ['Grid','Nuclear','Offshore_Wind','Onshore_Wind','Solar'] #generation technologies to be considered
#stor_techs: ['Geologic','Tank'] #storage technologies to be considered


#Import and export:
max_imports_ratio : 0 # 25% of the total hydrogen system demand
import_nodes  : [] #zones which can import hydrogen
min_exports_ratio : 0 # could be ratio or amount
export_nodes  : [] #zones which can import hydrogen

#Model constrains and costs:
overserved_cost  : 5 #$/kg
unserved_cost : 1000 #$/kg

#Time controls (use for intrayear analysis)
start : '1 Jan' #start date for intrayear analysis 
end : '7 Jan' # end date for intrayear analysis
coarse_resolution : 24 #resolution in hours to use for 1st step with pipeline location optimization (24 or higher recommended)
fine_resolution : 2 #resolution in hours to use for 2nd step with specified pipeline locations (1-4 recommended)
